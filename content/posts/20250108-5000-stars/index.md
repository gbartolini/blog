_CloudNativePG has surpassed 5,000 stars on GitHub! More than just a number,
this achievement reflects the trust, enthusiasm, and collaboration of the
Postgres and Kubernetes open-source community. I look back at the journey,
acknowledge the incredible contributions from users and maintainers, and invite
everyone to join us in shaping the future of cloud-native PostgreSQL._

Today, I'm thrilled to celebrate an incredible milestone for
[CloudNativePG](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg):
surpassing 5,000 stars on GitHub! This achievement reflects the vibrant
community that has grown around our open-source Kubernetes operator for
PostgreSQL, and it’s a moment to reflect on how far we’ve come together.

## A Journey Rooted in Innovation and Collaboration

[CloudNativePG was introduced](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/introducing-cloudnativepg-new-open-source-kubernetes-operator-postgres)
to address the growing need for a reliable, cloud-native solution to run
PostgreSQL in Kubernetes environments.
From the outset, our mission was clear: to provide a shared-nothing,
[cloud-neutral](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2024/11/20/cloud-neutral-postgres-databases-with-kubernetes-and-cloudnativepg/)
architecture that empowers organizations to confidently manage PostgreSQL
clusters, regardless of their deployment environment.

One of the ambitious OKRs I set early on for CloudNativePG at EDB was to
organically achieve 5,000 stars on GitHub within two years of its open-source
launch and to establish it as the most popular open-source PostgreSQL operator.
At the time, this felt like an almost unattainable goal—especially considering
that even the most successful open-source projects we had developed at
2ndQuadrant and EDB had fewer than 2,000 stars.
Achieving this milestone required relentless focus, a commitment to community
engagement, and the dedication of an incredible team of contributors. While it
took slightly longer—2.5 years instead of the planned two—we reached the goal.

Meanwhile, the project has evolved through the contributions of countless
community members and adopters, who have brought their ideas, use cases, and
expertise to the table. Whether through feature requests, bug reports, or
direct contributions, every interaction has helped shape CloudNativePG into the
robust operator it is today.

I would also like to thank [EDB](https://www.linkedin.com/company/edbpostgres/)
for their unwavering commitment to open-source development as the primary
contributing organisation to CloudNativePG—as well as their contributions to
the PostgreSQL database ecosystem. Their support has been instrumental in
driving the project’s success and fostering its growth.

## A Testament to Open Source Communities

Reaching 5,000 stars on GitHub is more than just a metric; it’s a testament to
the trust, enthusiasm, and dedication of the growing Postgres and Kubernetes
community around CloudNativePG. This milestone underscores the pivotal role of
collaboration in open-source software development. From enthusiastic early
adopters to robust large-scale deployments, the diverse range of use cases has
been both inspiring and instrumental in driving continuous improvements to
CloudNativePG.

## Looking Ahead

This milestone motivates us to continue pushing the boundaries of what’s
possible with PostgreSQL on Kubernetes.
Next week, CloudNativePG will be evaluated for inclusion in the CNCF Sandbox
([issue #128](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox/issues/128)),
marking another exciting chapter in our journey.

With plans for future releases, enhanced features, and broader integrations,
we’re eager to see what we can achieve together.
