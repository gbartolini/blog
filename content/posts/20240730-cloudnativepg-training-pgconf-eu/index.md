I am thrilled to announce that the first-ever public training session for
CloudNativePG will take place in Athens on October 22 as part of the 2024
PostgreSQL European Conference.

Titled [“Mastering PostgreSQL in Kubernetes with CloudNativePG”](https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5998-mastering-postgresql-in-kubernetes-with-cloudnativepg/),
this full-day training session will be delivered by Leonardo Cecchi and myself,
both founders and maintainers of CloudNativePG.

We will cover essential day-2 operations for PostgreSQL databases, including
monitoring, logging, troubleshooting, continuous backup, Point-In-Time
Recovery, scaling, switchover, and automated failover.

This session presents a unique opportunity to gain insights into the challenges
of running stateful workloads in Kubernetes and learn how to turn these
challenges into opportunities for PostgreSQL databases using CloudNativePG.

Leonardo and I will explore various deployment options and architectures to
help you identify and select the best fit for your use case, including advanced
scenarios beyond a single Kubernetes cluster.

Through practical sessions, we’ll guide you in creating a consistent and
reusable local environment using just open-source software, ensuring seamless
transitions from your laptop to production using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

For more information and registration, please visit the [PostgreSQL Conference Europe website](https://2024.pgconf.eu/).

Basic Kubernetes knowledge and practical experience are required to make the
most of this one-day session. If you are interested in the session but lack
Kubernetes skills, don't worry. Many resources are available online, including
self-paced learning classes that prepare you for the Certified Kubernetes
Administrator exam. My favourite is the [“Certified Kubernetes Administrator
(CKA) with Practice Tests” course by Mumshad Mannambeth on
Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/?couponCode=2021PM20).
In my experience, dedicating 45-60 minutes a day to this course can help you
become a CKA in 30-45 days, depending on your existing knowledge.

I invite you to join Leonardo and me for this exciting training opportunity and
become part of a vibrant community dedicated to mastering PostgreSQL in
Kubernetes. Don’t miss out on this chance to enhance your skills and network
with professionals in the field.
