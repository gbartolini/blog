Check out my posts on navigating [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) databases
in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) using [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io).
We'll be exploring a fully open-source stack that's a breeze to deploy anywhere â€“
from on-premises setups to multi-cloud adventures.

*Just a heads up, the opinions shared here are all mine*.
